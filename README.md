## What it does
If you take the binary into the sd of the rubber ducky or you burn the ino file into a digispark and you conect them throught an otg cable to a phone it will automaticaly start to try passwords

## Things to have in account
In some phones, there is a limit of trys per minute, so be care of it. To solve it,you can revise the txt file and add some time each 5 try.
